The goal for our program is to understand how different features of songs potentially contribute to genre labeling on Spotify. Our results revealed that genre labels heavily overlap, indicating that songs often share qualities between genres. We also used clustering in hopes of visualizing natural grouping by genre through machine learning. However, by taking a look at our results, we found that there were no distinct groups that formed. Finally, we created a classifier in order to predict songs based on their measured characteristics. With an accuracy score of about 49%, our classifier works relatively well but may confuse genres that share heavy overlap in terms of traits.
